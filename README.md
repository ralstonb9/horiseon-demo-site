# horiseon-demo-site

## Description

In this challenge I was tasked with looking over the CSS and HTML of a mock website, after assessing the code I next had to fix any bugs in the code and combine or eliminate code where ever possible.

## Usage

After opening the page in your browser there are three links in the top right corner of the page. clicking on any of the links will then take you to the section of the page wit hte corresponding information.

[the Horiseon webpage has a navigation bar at the top right corner that take you to the sections with photos and text descriptions](.assets/images/screenshot.png)
